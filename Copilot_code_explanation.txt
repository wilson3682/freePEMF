You said: thanks, how are the frequencies generated and
thanks, how are the frequencies generated and witch timer is being used?
Copilot said: In the provided firmware, frequencies are generated
In the provided firmware, frequencies are generated using two different methods depending on the range of frequencies required, and the specific timer/counter hardware of the Arduino Nano is utilized for one of the methods. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Software-Based Frequency Generation
This method is used for lower frequencies (up to around 60 Hz). It does not rely heavily on the hardware timer and instead uses millis() for timing.

Key Function: freq()

It calculates the on-time (high) and off-time (low) of the signal based on the desired frequency and duty cycle (PWM).
The signal is generated by toggling the output pin (coilPin) and managing the timing using millis().
This approach is less precise but sufficient for lower frequencies.
How It Works:

The duty cycle is calculated as:
on-time
=
(
PWM
100
)
Ã—
(
1000
frequency
)
off-time
=
(
1
âˆ’
PWM
100
)
Ã—
(
1000
frequency
)
The microcontroller turns the signal on and off at these calculated intervals using millis().
2. Hardware-Based Frequency Generation
This method is used for higher frequencies (above 60 Hz, up to 16 kHz) and leverages the Timer 0 hardware in the Arduino Nano.

Key Function: xfreq()

It uses Timer 0 in Fast PWM Mode to generate precise square wave signals with frequencies up to 16 kHz.
The timer registers (TCCR0A, TCCR0B, OCR0A, OCR0B) are configured to control the frequency and duty cycle.
How It Works:

The timer is set to Fast PWM Mode (Mode 7) with the TOP value defined by OCR0A.
The frequency is calculated as:
Frequency
=
CPU Clock (16 MHz)
Prescaler
Ã—
(
OCR0A
+
1
)
The prescaler is chosen based on the desired frequency:
Prescaler 1024 for frequencies below 24.5 kHz.
Prescaler 256, 64, or 8 for higher frequencies.
The duty cycle is set by OCR0B:
Duty Cycle
=
(
OCR0B
OCR0A
)
Ã—
100
Registers Used:

TCCR0A: Configures the PWM mode and output compare behavior.
TCCR0B: Configures the prescaler and waveform generation mode.
OCR0A: Sets the TOP value for frequency control.
OCR0B: Sets the duty cycle.
Timer Selection
Timer 0 is used for high-frequency generation in xfreq():

It is a 8-bit timer available on the Arduino Nano.
It is typically used for internal functions like delay() and millis(), but this firmware reconfigures it when high-frequency signal generation is required.
For low frequencies, the software method in freq() does not explicitly utilize hardware timers but relies on millis(), which internally uses Timer 0 as well.

Summary
Low Frequencies (â‰¤ 60 Hz):

Generated via software control in freq().
Uses millis() for timing, with a calculated on/off interval.
High Frequencies (> 60 Hz):

Generated via hardware control in xfreq().
Utilizes Timer 0 in Fast PWM Mode for precise frequency and duty cycle control.
Frequency range: 61 Hz to 16 kHz.
This dual approach ensures both flexibility (low frequencies) and precision (high frequencies) for the device's therapeutic applications.
